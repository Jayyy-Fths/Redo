            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>Musashi began his career as a fighter early in life; at age 13, he killed a man in single combat. 
                In 1600, he was on the losing side of the Battle of Sekigahara, which paved the way for establishing 
                the Tokugawa shogunate, becoming one of the rōnin (masterless samurai). Beyond his martial prowess, Musashi 
                was also an accomplished artist, engaging in painting, sculpture, calligraphy, and poetry. He practiced suiboku-ga, 
                a Japanese ink painting style.

            <h2>Philosophy</h2>
            <p>Miyamoto Musashi’s philosophy revolves around self-discipline, adaptability, and self-reliance. His <strong>Book of Five Rings</strong> teaches strategy through five elements:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Earth:</strong> Establishing a solid foundation.</li>
                <li><strong>Water:</strong> Adapting fluidly to any situation.</li>
                <li><strong>Fire:</strong> Taking decisive and swift action.</li>
                <li><strong>Wind:</strong> Learning from other schools and strategies.</li>
                <li><strong>Void:</strong> Trusting intuition and deeper understanding.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>His <strong>Dokkōdō ("The Path of Aloneness")</strong> outlines 21 principles emphasizing detachment, simplicity, and honor. Key teachings include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Accepting everything as it is.</li>
                <li>Not being controlled by emotions or material possessions.</li>
                <li>Focusing on self-mastery and lifelong learning.</li>
                <li>Living with honor and without regret.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Musashi believed in minimalism, personal discipline, and mastering one's craft, inspiring people far beyond martial arts.</p>
